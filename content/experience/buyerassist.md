### Description

- Developed an event-driven serverless integration pipeline using AWS Lambda and EventBridge, facilitating seamless bidirectional synchronization of customer data between Salesforce and Boomerang, thereby enhancing customer onboarding experience.
- Developed a Slack bot that sent interactive daily notifications to customers, facilitating direct actions such as task assignments and completions from within Slack. This streamlined operations and boosted sales by over 50%.
- Engineered a job tracking system to monitor asynchronous data transfer jobs via AWS AppFlow. This dramatically enhanced the reliability and transparency of data transfers between Boomerang and Salesforce.
- Designed and implemented a configuration-driven framework to extend the pattern-matching capability of AWS EventBridge, preventing over 1000 false invocations of AWS Lambda functions every day.
